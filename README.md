This assignment implements a simple Directory Service to record name, phone number, email etc.
For review and testing the application is deployed in a AWS instance with dockerized tomcat server and postgresql.
Following is the base url of the application:

There is also an additional UI to monitor the docker containers running in AWS. Following is the link-
